# [PROPOSAL -- "MEET SYNC" Project 2 - Group 6](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+)


Team: Justin W, Luke D, Chris G, Henry H

# [*** Summary ***](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+)

Manager is seeking to create a meeting amongst many employees with different schedules. Manager will specify a time block length for meeting. 

Employees (users) will enter in the schedule the current commitments as time blocks.

Our app will filter thru the employees' schedules and find the first time block everyone is available.


# [*** User Stories ***](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+)

We can frame this challenge as follows:

```diff
+ AS A business manager/owner
+
+ I WANT an app with a database for my employees
+
+ SO THAT I can sync their schedules to set up meeting
```

```diff
+ AS A the team lead 
+ 
+ I WANT an app with a database for my team members
+
+ SO THAT I can sync their schedules to set up meeting
```
